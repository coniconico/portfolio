Personal Portfolio 

These are my first lines of code since 2010...

I learned HTML & CSS (along with web oriented graphic and communications skills) in my first years of university and I tought that programming was really not for me.
But 10 years later, I'm still looking for something to put my soul into and make it my living. 
My point of view is different and I've obviously grown alot (the web grown alot too). 
I can now see clearly how my artistic and creative self can blossom into web developpement and how all my other non-web skills can be transposed into it :).
So I'm back at it ! 
I really liked the process, but I'm not so confident about the final result, so I updated it and its almost empty now while I work on a brand new version of it.
